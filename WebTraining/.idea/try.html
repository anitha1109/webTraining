<h2 class="special">IT buisness</h2>
<h3>My Job</h3>
<p>I started as an apprentice in the IT buisness. It has been a dream for me for a long time.<br>
    Since I was a child I always liked to deal with computers and wondered about the technology.<br>
    I also got the wish to create an own Website or to program something else.<br> Now I'm really happy that
    I have the opportunity to learn that.
