<h2> My interests in the holiday</h2>
<h3>Going to the beach</h3>
<pre>
    I adore to go to the beach and to swim in the sea.
    I also like to play with the sand or just to lay in a
    lounger. The beach is an absoloute paradise to me. I almost
    like everything on the beach, except the insects, jellyfish and
    so on. Nevertheless to go to the beach always relaxed me more than something else.

<h3>Shopping</h3>
<pre>
    I LOVE to go shopping no matter where I am.
    Shopping makes me so happy. To buy something
    for me or for someone else is a great feeling
    to me. I especially like to buy stuffs for people
    I really like. That makes me and them happy at
    the same time. So for me shopping is a must in
    holidays.

<h3>Visiting special places</h3>
<pre>
    In my opinion it is also a must to me to visit special
    places in the holidays. For example if you're in paris
    it would make sense to visit the eiffel tower. I mean
    if you're already there and have the opportunity then
    why not. But I also love to visit leisure parks. I
    always have fun there.
